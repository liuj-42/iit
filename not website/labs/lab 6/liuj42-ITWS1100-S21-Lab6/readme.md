Lab 6: JQuery

Thoughts about the lab:
I think that this lab was fun. I'm not sure if it was because of my prior
experience with other progamming languages, but javascript and jquery seems 
to be intuitive enough that it wasn't too hard for me to get the hang of.

There is one thing though, when I put the html file through the validator 
(https://validator.w3.org/), I got 2 warnings, both of them for the 
<script type="text/javascript" part of the code, with the statement that 
"The type attribute is unnecessary for JavaScript resources."
