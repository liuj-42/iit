	<h1>Reverse Madlibs Application</h1>
	<p>
	This application was created by Norbert Szmyt, Toni Sanders, and Jaikrishen Wadhwani as a Introduction to Information Technology term 
	project to demonstrate our mastery of HTML/CSS, javascript, and user design.
	</p>
    <p>
    This application is based of the word game Mad Libs. Mad Libs is a game that is played by several people.  The game consists of one person
	 asking the other players for adjectives, nouns, verbs and other parts of speech to complete the missing words of a story that is given.
	</p>
    <p>
    This application seeks to reverse the process.  The Reverse Mad Libs application asks the user to write a story in the Mad Libs format.  
	When the user submits the story, the application will fill in the blanks using random words from a database. This application is completely 
	contained to one page that links to a database of words. The main page is where the user inputs the story of their creation and receives the 
	output of great hilarity.  The database consists of multiple lists separated by type.
	</p>

	<h2>Instructions:</h2>
	<p>
	Enter a short story using the Mad Lib format in the text box below. Where you would like a blank, type the tag for the corresponding 
	lexical or part of speech in the location. Make sure to include the slashes on both sides and spell the terms correctly.  Click on the 
	submit button on completion. Enjoy a good laugh!
